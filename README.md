# SafeCraft plugin for Craft CMS

SafeCraft plugin allows you to custom backup your Craft website locally or to a FTP destination. 

(Inspired by: https://straightupcraft.com/craft-plugins/dump by PutYourLightsOn)

## Installation

To install SafeCraft, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `safecraft` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2.  -OR- do a `git clone https://github.com/quebecstudio/safecraft.git` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder.  You can then update it with `git pull`
3. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
4. The plugin folder should be named `managecraft` for Craft to see it.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.

SafeCraft works on Craft 2.4.x and Craft 2.5.x.


## Configuring SafeCraft

In settings, you can select what you want to include in your backup archive, then choose where you want to move it (FTP or Craft storage)
